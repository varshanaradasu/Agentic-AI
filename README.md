# Agentic-AI
This repository contains an implementation of an Agentic AI Developer, a system that leverages AI agents to autonomously plan, code, and execute development tasks. The notebook demonstrates how AI can act as a developer—taking high-level instructions and producing working software with minimal human intervention.

📌 Features

🧠 Autonomous AI Agents – Break down tasks, reason, and execute them step-by-step.

⚡ Code Generation & Execution – Generate, test, and refine code directly in the notebook.

🔍 Reasoning & Planning – Uses structured reasoning to decide the best approach.

🛠️ Extensible Framework – Can be adapted for different domains like web dev, data science, or automation.

jupyter notebook Agentic_AI.ipynb

🧩 Usage

Open the notebook.

Provide a high-level task (e.g., "build a calculator web app").

The AI agent will:

Break down the problem.

Generate the necessary code.

Execute and refine until completion.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook

LLM-based Agent Framework (can be extended with OpenAI, LangChain, AutoGen, etc.)

📈 Roadmap

 Add multi-agent collaboration.

 Integrate with external APIs/tools.

 Expand test cases and error recovery.

 Create a web UI for easier interaction.
